# Algorithms are Fun

Free (my) resources for any unimelb classes that teach algorithms and the C language.

## Please Note:

- The accuracy of the resources are not guaranteed, since things may change over time.
- The completeness of the resources are not guaranteed, since I like skipping lectures.
- As per university policy, I can only share assignment solutions **after the mark of the assignment has been released**.

## Missing:

- If anyone still has the assignment specs from COMP10002 semester 1 2017 please share with me so I can complete the resources. Right now the solutions don't even describe what was the problem to be solved.

## And remember:

*algorithms are fun*
